# Overview

Leading the product management & digital transformation of the groups combined 12 marketing applications (including LSEG.com londonstockexchange.com & refinitiv.com). Responsible for a team of 6 people and 4 Scrum teams to maintain & enhance existing websites whilst running simultaneous CapEx projects to re-platform customer facing sites & applications.

After the acquisition of Refinitiv by the London Stock Exchange Group, the digital marketing team was re-organised with digital transformation at the heart of all activities. My role was to lead our interaction with technology to deliver this business change for the wider marketing team. Acting as Product Manager & Owner, my role is to lead a team of specialists who continue to improve and re-platform websites from Drupal to Adobe.

Rationalising the shared technology stack across the applications remains a primary driver to ensure we; remove inefficiency, reduce cost, build a common customer experience & introduce modern technologies such as machine learning & customer analytics.
