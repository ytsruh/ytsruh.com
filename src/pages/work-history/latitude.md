# Overview

My role at Latitude was an Account Manager for our key Middle Eastern clients. These included MarkaVIP, Emirates Airlines, Hilton Hotels, Thomson Reuters and eXtra Stores. As Account Manager I was tasked with acting as the primary point of contact for clients regarding their digital marketing accounts, managed by Latitude - PPC, SEO & Social media as well as Analytics & Conversion Rate Optimisation.

Invited over to the region by Google, Latitude set up its office to help stimulate the market by offering a bespoke & performance focussed digital marketing service. Externally my role was client facing to help educate & communicate with clients about the current state and future of their accounts by liaising with multiple internal stakeholders. Internally my role was to represent the client at team meetings, ensure high standards were met and report progress & updates back to clients on a daily basis.

A large part of my role became educating clients about the latest features of Google that were just becoming available in the region and promoting the ideas of 'performance first' & 'mobile first' to the region. Over time, analytics implementation became a growing part of my role as clients adapted to higher standards & demand for digital marketing data rapidly grew overtime. Many clients requested advanced reporting and data visualisation using tools such as Google Data Studio, BigQuery and various API's.
