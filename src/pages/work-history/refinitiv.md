# Overview

Responsible for the full lifecycle product management of 7 local language sites acting as Product Owner within the Scrum team. The localisation team was made up of 5 language specialists & 1 Project Manager. Languages included; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, French, Portuguese & Spanish.

The teamâ€™s role was to maintain, update & iterate our local language digital experiences drawing on expertise across the business including UX, development & marketing to drive customer engagement in those local markets. The team was also responsible for the machine-based translation capability for the wider group marketing team by utilising a suite of ML/AI software. All websites were revenue generating and measured against KPI's. Local language strategy was new for the Refinitiv business and was seen as one of the growth engines of the overall digital strategy.

Attending daily scrum meetings & various ceremonies, my role was to represent our local language websites to our technology team and represent the aspirational future of the strategy. My role was to organise sprints ensuring that key initiatives were prioritised and delivered on time in order to meet our business objectives. The localisation & UX teams helped me to understand the regional needs/wishes of website users to ensure we continue to improve the customer & digital experience.

The team had a secondary responsibility to support the wider digital team with local language requirements such as writing Paid Search adverts, SEO optimisations of the websites or advising on social media posting/advertising.
